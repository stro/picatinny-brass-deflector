# Picatinny-mounted Brass Deflector

This is a brass deflector for modern sporting rifles (AR, SCR, etc). 

Brass deflector is mounted on the top rail. It was designed to work with .223 Remington and .300 AAC Blackout calibers.
Other calibers may or may not have the desired effect. It was also tested and works on M&P15-22 with .22LR brass.

There are three versions with different mount points.

* Front Rail.
 * Pros: you can run any optics or red dot sights with it because it doesn't take any slots from the upper receiver.
 * Cons: long arm is more susceptible for accidental breakups. 

* Upper Receiver: Front
 * Pros: you can use it if your handguard doesn't have railings. 
 * Cons: occupies some slots on the upper receiver.

* Upper Receiver: Back
 * Pros: you can use it if your handguard doesn't have railings; no arm means it's harder to break accidentally 
 * Cons: takes slots usually used by iron sights. 

Clamp part is the same for all three mount points.

You'll also need:

* two 6-32x1-1/2 hex bolts (for 7/64" hex wrench).
* two 6-32 wing nuts. You can use any nuts but wing nuts are easier to operate. 

Brass deflector is a very useful accessory either if you want to collect your brass, or there are people close to your bench and you want to provide some common courtesy.
Instead of a regular brass ejection pattern (3:45 horizontal), your brass will be directed downwards at 2:45-3:00 angle.
If you're shooting from the bench, all your brass will stay on the bench.

Since it's Picatinny-mounted, both installation and removal are very easy.
Mount it on your first and third grooves (front rail or upper receiver - back), or last and third last ones (upper receiver - front).

Tighten the wing nuts but don't apply too much force.
